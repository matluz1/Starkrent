# Starkrent

A non-fungible token (NFT) rental protocol built on StarkNet that allows users to rent out their NFTs to others for a specified amount of time.

The protocol is built on StarkNet, which is a decentralized network that uses zero-knowledge proofs to provide enhanced privacy and security for transactions. The protocol allows NFT owners to set their own rental terms, such as the duration of the rental period and the price, and facilitate the secure transfer of the NFT from the owner to the renter. Starkrent also include a mechanism for ensuring that the NFT is returned to the owner at the end of the rental period.

Overall, Starkrent provide a convenient and secure way for NFT owners to earn additional income from their assets while also giving others the opportunity to temporarily use unique and valuable NFTs.
